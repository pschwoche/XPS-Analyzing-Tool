# XPS Analyzing Tool

Tool for analyzing XPS spectra

This tool is for visualize and editing the original data, such as applying a digital filter, subtract backgrounds, shift energies.
You will also be able to fit functions (Voigt, Gaussian, ... ) to the data and save the results in files.

Furthermore a prediction of the spectra based on a selection of elemtens will be implemented as well as a automated, but rough interpretation / fit of the data, by estimating the proportions of possible substances/elements.
